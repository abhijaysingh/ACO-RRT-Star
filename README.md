# ACO-RRT* and RRT* for 2D Path Planning

This repository implements an approach to path finding by combining Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) with the RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) algorithm. This hybrid method leverages the strengths of both algorithms to find efficient paths in complex environments.

## Setup

To install the required dependencies, navigate to the project folder and use the following commands

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

* **ACO-RRT\*** 
    
    To run ACO-RRT*, navigate to the project folder and use the following commands
  
    ```bash
    cd <path_to_project>/code/
    python3 ACO_RRT*.py
    ```

* **RRT\***

    To run RRT*, navigate to the project folder and use the following commands
  
    ```bash
    cd <path_to_project>/code/
    python3 RRT*.py
    ```
